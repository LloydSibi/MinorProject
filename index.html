        founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar.
        The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot 
        before.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was
        a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. 
        The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. It was controlled by
        Sikarwar Rajputs from 7th to 16th century CE till the Battle of Khanwa (1527).
